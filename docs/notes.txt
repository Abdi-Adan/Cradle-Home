Django's templating language is based on
- Template tags control the rendering of the template and look like {% tag %}
- Template variables get replaced with values when the template is rendered and look like {{ variable }}
- Template filters allow you to modify variables for display and look like {{variable|filter }}.

Class-based views offer advantages over function-based views for some use cases. (CBV)
They have the following features:
    • Organizing code related to HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, or PUT, in separate methods, instead of using conditional branching
    • Using multiple inheritance to create reusable view classes (also known as mixins)
